	<p>So, that's me. Yes, I wear glasses and everything more than a foot away
	is blurry without them.</p>
	
	<p>My fedora is a little crooked in this picture. Speaking of the fedora,
	you'd be hardpressed to see me outside without one.	That is, unless I'm
	playing soccer or clogging (you'll learn about clogging	further down the page)
	or doing some other physical activity. Why the fedora instead of a regular
	ball cap, you ask? I mainly like the fedora because it is easy to put on
	without the use of hands. I suppose a bowler hat would be too, but the fedora
	looks better.</p>
	
	<p>Why should it matter that the fedora is easy to put on without using hands?
	Well, my hands are ... troubled. I have Cerebral Palsy (CP). My CP affects
	mainly my upper body, so I do mostly everything with my feet. This website
	you are looking at was created by me typing with my feet. I also play video
	games and use remotes with my feet. (I'm pretty good at bowling on the Wii.)
	As to why I wear a hat: it's to help shade my eyes and keep the rain off my
	glasses. Rain drops on glasses are annoying.</p>

	<p>I am a Christian. I do believe that Jesus came to Earth and died for the
	sins of all. He is the Savior and Lord of my life. I was raised in a Southern
	Baptist church and I share many of the doctinal beliefs of the traditional
	Southern Baptist.</p>

	<p>One of those beliefs is that everyone can be saved. Another is that we all
	have a role to play in the body of Christ. I contribute to this through church
	and my website, <a href="http://www.thewordkeeper.com" target="new">The Word
	Keeper</a> (WK). On WK, I post my notes from the morning sermon at my church.
	There are times when I neglect the website, but I intend to be more consistent
	in keeping it updated from now on.</p>

    <p>It's hard to type with one's feet at a regular desk. So I designed a
	custom desk using Google Sketchup and my dad constructed it for me. It was
	originally just a board, pretty much, that set on the end of a chase lounge.
	We have added a shelf to the back of it so I could use a second monitor. The
	shelf is also nice to have for putting other things on, like games or pens or
	whatever else. This corner of my room has been named "The Cave" by my family.</p>

	<p>You might notice the PS3 in the picture. I enjoy video games. My favorite
	games are sports games, racing games, and RPGs. I'm not too good at shooting
	games, but	I do find them fun to play from time to time. Madden, Fifa,	and
	Gran Turismo are my three favorites. I'm not the greatest at any of these
	games, but I can hang with most people, especially in Madden. Playing in an
	online league has improved my Madden skills this year for sure.</p>

	<p>I have another design in the works for a gaming and computer cabinet. I
	originally designed it to hold a PS3, but then the PS4 was announced and I
	need to check its dimensions so the cabinet can be made to accommodate one.</p>

	<p>I graduated from Middle Tennesse State University (MTSU) in May 2013. My
	degree is a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (CS). My final GPA was
	3.769. Most of my non-A grades were in classes that weren't CSclasses. The CS
	teachers at MTSU are awesome. The CS students were all pretty cool too. We had
	some fun times in most of my classes.</p>

	<p>Most people get a ring when they graduate. I don't do good with rings. So
	I designed a clip. Well, I designed the printed part. I know it's a money
	clip, but my intentions are to find a way to clip it to my fedora.</p>
